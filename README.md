## Preview of app

## Context 
  - This is the final project I was given for MOD 1 of Turing. When this project was assigned I was 5 weeks into the Turing school program. I had a week to work on this project while I was also studying and practicing for my final assment and other assignments. Check project specs [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo-v2.html)

## Technology Used
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Atom
  - GitHub
## Wins
  - My frist win came when I was able to get the game to fully function in my dev tools. This showed that I was able to update my data model first and that is was functional. 
  - My second win was learning new methods to implement such as a timeout. Using this project to continue my learning was a big win for me and something I really enjoyed
# Challenges
  - My first big challenge came with developing a data model first. In previous projects I've used the DOM first and the data model second. I spent extra time making sure my data model came first and the DOM came second. 
  - The second challenge was with styling. There was a lot of times where the functionality was working but the images or containers were not located or styled how I wanted them to be. Primarily on scenes that are populated based on the player and computer selections.
